    "# 09. Zarr Access for NetCDF4 files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timing:\n",
    "- Exercise: 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Zarr is an open source library for storing N-dimensional array data.  It supports multidimensional arrays with attributes and dimensions similar to NetCDF4, and it can be read by XArray.  Zarr is often used for data held in cloud object storage (like Amazon S3), because it is better optimized for these situations than NetCDF4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [zarr-eosdis-store library](https://github.com/nasa/zarr-eosdis-store) allows NASA EOSDIS NetCDF4 files to be read more efficiently by transferring only file metadata and data needed for computation in a small number of requests, rather than moving the whole file or making many small requests.  It works by making the files directly readable by the [Zarr Python library](https://zarr.readthedocs.io) and XArray across a network.  To use it, files must have a corresponding metadata file ending in `.dmrpp`, which increasingly true for cloud-accessible EOSDIS data.  https://github.com/nasa/zarr-eosdis-store\n",
    "\n",
    "The zarr-eosdis-store library provides several benefits over downloading EOSDIS data files and accessing them using XArray, NetCDF4, or HDF5 Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It only downloads the chunks of data you actually read, so if you don't read all variables or the full spatiotemporal extent of a file, you usually won't spend time downloading those portions of the file\n",
    "* It parallelizes and optimizes downloads for the portions of files you do read, so download speeds can be faster in general\n",
    "* It automatically interoperates with Earthdata Login if you have a .netrc file set up\n",
    "* It is aware of some EOSDIS cloud implementation quirks and provides caching that can save time for repeated requests to individual files\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be faster than using XArray pointing NetCDF4 files with s3:// URLs, depending on the file's internal structure, and is often more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using this library when:\n",
    "1. The portion of the data file you need to use is much smaller than the full file, e.g. in cases of spatial subsets or reading a single variable from a file containing several\n",
    "1. s3:// URLs are not readily available\n",
    "1. Code need to run outside of the AWS cloud or us-west-2 region or in a hybrid cloud / non-cloud manner\n",
    "1. s3:// access using XArray seems slower than you would expect (possibly due to unoptimized internal file structure)\n",
    "1. No readily-available, public, cloud-optimized version of the data exists already. The example we show _is_ also available as an AWS Public Dataset: https://registry.opendata.aws/mur/\n",
    "1. Adding \".dmrpp\" to the end of a data URL returns a file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build on prior knowledge from CMR and Earthdata Login tutorials\n",
    "2. Work through an example of using the EOSDIS Zarr Store to access data using XArray\n",
    "3. Learn about the Zarr format and library for accessing data in the cloud\n",
