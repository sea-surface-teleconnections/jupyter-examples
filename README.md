# Sea surface teleconnections with coastal southern California wind and cloud patterns linked to climate, land, ocean, anomalies 



Always nice to have a status badge of all your pipelines in the readme

> About This Project:
* This Project Focuses on Assembling multi-decadal time series datasets of RS weather, land, and ocean data to assess spatial and temporal tele-connections linked to cloud cover, high temperature and wind patterns
* Analyze annual and intra-annual variations for ocean variables linked to atmospheric conditions producing severe weather events using Python, R, and GIS tools
* Identify mechanisms for PO.DAAC to facilitate access, manipulation, and processing of data for external users, communities, and the larger public
*  Develop visualizations, ArcGIS StoryMaps, lab exercises, tutorials, and videos for the public and future students

> Goals:
* Provide a report outlining the approach, results for a research paper, and presentations at APCG or AGU
* Provide data access feedback to PO.DAAC
* Publish ArcGIS StoryMaps for community partners to share and visualize results
* Create demos and class exercises to manipulate data and generate products for the larger public, including visualizations for underserved communities to better understand the benefits of RS data science 
* Give presentations to ARCS colloquium and JPL student program


## Getting Started

Datasets: 
* [Ocean Link](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.0?ids=Processing%20Levels:Keywords&values=4%20-%20Gridded%20Model%20Output::Oceans:Ocean%20Temperature&provider=PODAAC)


### Prerequisites

Some of the modules used include:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev)
- [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [cartopy](https://pypi.org/project/Cartopy/)

### Installing

Installation steps are necessary so go through each step to do so 

```
git clone https://github.com/sea-surface-teleconnections/jupyter-examples.git
```


## License

Most like MIT License because we like open sourcing but it can be whatever license you like - Again we want to put the license in a different file to not make the readme too big [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)

## Acknowledgments
